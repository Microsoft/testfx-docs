## Roadmap
We typically **plan for a quarter**, establish a set of themes we want to work towards, and then schedule work each sprint supporting those themes. Here are the themes we will work on this quarter.

### Extensibility
Testing use cases come with their own nuances. The MSTest test framework ought to allow developers to build a variety of extensions to address these use cases â€“ for e.g. via attributes, assertions, additional ways to data drive a test, controlling test case execution, etc. We will enable a powerful extensibility model that will allow building such a variety of extensions.
 - Enable a powerful extensibility model.

### Parallel Test Execution
The MSTest test framework currently lacks the ability to execute tests in parallel. We will fix that. And will do so using the same extensibility model.
 - Enable parallel test execution.

### Compat issues
The MSTest test framework has a strong history. We will strive to achieve compatibility with earlier versions where it would be of overall benefit to the community. See our blog post [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2017/02/25/mstest-v2-now-and-ahead/) for several such issues you reported that we have already fixed.
 - Address compat issues as appropriate.

### Retry mechanism
The MSTest test framework has lack of retry mechanism which is common in other test frameworks and runners like Nunit. The wrapper implementation is alredy exist https://automatetheplanet.com/mstest-rerun-failed-tests-through-mstest-exe-wrapper-application/
 - Implement retry mechanism to make a test run more stable.


## Summary
These are examples of the work we will be focusing on in the next quarter. We will provide much more detail through individual issues. Follow along, and let us know what you think. We look forward to working with you!
